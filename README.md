# usb-templates

Filesystem templates for USB sticks deployed at our events.

`robot/` - a robot code USB stick. Contains a demonstration `main.py`.

`arena/` - arena USBs (one per zone). Contains the necessary metadata to enable the robot to know what zone it's in at runtime.

https://github.com/kierdavis/flashusb may come in useful for copying these onto actual USB sticks.
